## Description
This is a simple note taker application created to write and save notes. It can help you keep track of things you need to get done or it can be a place to write things you don't want to forget. However you decide to use it, it is ready to take your notes. This project utilizes Express.js to handle the html and api routes between the client and the db.json file, and uses data persistence to store the data so it can be retrieved and used later if the user decides to close or restart the application.

## Usage
To use this application navigate to the deployed application using the link below. To begin click the "Get Started" button. You will then be taken to a notes page with saved notes on the left side and on the right, a form for the user to enter their new note. The notes on the left also have a red delete button if the user wishes to delete the note completely. If you click on any of the notes on the left it is opened fully on the right side and you can view the entire note. From there, there is a "New Note" button on the top right that takes you back to the new note form. Then the user can enter a note title and the note text and two buttons will render on the top right. One button is to save the note and the other is to clear the form. If the user clicks the "Clear Form" button the form will be cleared and a new note can be entered. If the user clicks the "Save Note" button the note is saved and can be seen in the list of saved notes on the left.
