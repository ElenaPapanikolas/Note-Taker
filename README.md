To begin click the "Get Started" button. You will then be taken to a notes page with previously entered notes on the left side and on the right, a form for the user to enter their new note. The notes on the left also have a red delete button if the user wishes to delete the note completely. If you click on any of the notes on the left it is opened fully on thr right side. From there, there is a "New Note" button on the top right that takes you back to the new note form. Then the user enters a note title and the note text and two buttons will render on the top right. One button is to save the note and the other is to clear the form. If the user clicks the "Clear Form" button the form will be cleared and a new note can be entered. If the user clicks the "Save Note" button the note is saved and can be seen in the list of saved notes on the left.
